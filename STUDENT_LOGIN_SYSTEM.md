# 👥 Student Login System - Setup Complete!

## What I Created

A **simple login system** where students enter **username + password** before using the editor!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Students:

1. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. **First time?** Click "Create Account"
   - Enter username (e.g., "john_doe")
   - Enter password
   - Click "Create Account"
3. **Next time?** Just sign in
   - Enter username
   - Enter password
   - Click "Sign In"
4. **Redirected to editor** → Start coding!

### For Admin (You):

1. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
2. **Enter your secret key**
3. **See all students by name!**
   - Student Name column shows their username
   - See how many times each student executed code
   - Track their errors
   - Identify best performing students

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Now Shows:

```
Student Name  | Executions | Errors | Last Activity
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
john_doe      | 25         | 2      | 2025-01-23 1:30 AM
jane_smith    | 18         | 0      | 2025-01-23 1:25 AM  ← Best Student!
mike_jones    | 12         | 5      | 2025-01-23 1:20 AM
```

**Easy to identify:**
